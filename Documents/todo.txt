1.  split the data from the excel sheet into two separate .csv's, one for training and one for testing.
    update the mapreduce to use only the training data
2.  create more mapreduce functions to create more insights, implement using plotly
3.  implement time-series analysis using both tensorflow/pytorch and prophet, and compare which provides better results

1. Organize File Structure
     Data
        Have Data in one directory, the original raw data and then the data we clean/process
        Hadoop Map Reduce Output Data can also go here
     Python (Scripts)
        We should probably have all our scripts in one spot
        A Directory for scripts pertaining to anything Mapreduce
     Analysis
        Another directory for analytics
        main.py (since it currently contains our Dash stuff)
        Prophet_test.py
        test.py

2. Clean up any remaining data, like combining the transaction date with the transaction time into a single column
    Normalize store and product names (i.e. Store_1 vs Store 2)
    Make sure there are no null or zero values
    Add a revenue column directly

3. We can enhance the capabilities of our MapReduceâ€¦
    Daily Revenue per Item
    Monthly Revenue per Store
    Average_Transcation_Value
    Hourly Revenue per Store

4. Add more features to our Dash visualization
    Be able to change store, product, or date range
    Change time frame from daily to weekly to monthly
    Maybe be able to sort to find out Top 10 Products or easily find peaks

5. Add different visualizations
    Bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and trend lines

6. Expand prophet capabilities
    Instead of prophet focusing on just one store lets have it loop through all of them and then find its error predictions
    Add other forecasting models?
    Maybe try Arima, LSTM, or XGBoost and compare their results to prophet

7. Use all these metrics to get insights into our data
